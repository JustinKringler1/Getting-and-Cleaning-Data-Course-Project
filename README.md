Located in these files is the readme for more about this dataset and what it is used for.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The file run_analysis.R is intended to be ran all at once to produce a tidy dataset.

Before running the script make sure to change the location of the file paths with your own.
